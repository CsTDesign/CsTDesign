### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cory Taylor. I am a passionate graphic designer, developer, and graduate of Savvy Coders' Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. I create delightful experiences with over 7+ years of professional information technology expertise, actively seeking new opportunities to solve problems through effective and creative design experiences. Proficiently leveraging well-crafted, visual detail is key to delivering impactful solutions to fulfill client needs under time-restictive deadlines.

Let's network. Find me here on GitHub or LinkedIn.

- ðŸ”­ I recently completed Savvy Coders' Full Stack Web Development cohort. As part of this cohort, our task was to design a functional single page application that solves a problem, using everything we learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. In my case, I created an app to help make the process of meal prepping easier (https://imealprep.netlify.app/).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning other Front End Libraries such as Bootstrap, SASS, jQuery, React, and Redux to keep my coding knowledge fresh.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate and network with anybody in the Web Development field for job opportunities and space for my web development expertise to grow.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything within the Full Stack field. As I continue to learn each day, I will offer help to the best of my abilities.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Some people like to joke about how I share the same name as the lead singer of the heavy metal band Slipknot. Unlike him, I don't have an E in my first name.
