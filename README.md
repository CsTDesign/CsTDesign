I'm Cory Taylor. I am a passionate graphic designer and current student of Savvy Coders' Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. I'm a creator of delightful experiences with over 7+ years of professional information technology expertise, actively seeking new opportunities  to solve problems through effective and creative design experiences. Proficiently leveraging well-crafted, visual detail is key to delivering impactful solutions to fulfill client needs under time-restictive deadlines.

Let's network. Find me here on GitHub or LinkedIn.

Our task is to design a functional single page application that solves a problem, using everything we learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. In my case, I am creating an app to help make the process of meal prepping easier.
